=========================
Observer Target List Tool
=========================

Status: *Planned*

Overview
========

   - ``observer_target_list``: The extant observer target list tool
     (https://confluence.lowell.edu/display/LDTOI/Observer+Target+List+User+Manual)
     was produced in 2015 using an old Java Runtime Environment that is not available on
     most modern operating systems.  It still runs happily on the LDT observer machines,
     but those will need to be replaced at some point.  This python version will provide
     a future-proof solution.


Usage
=====

Usage information will be added here once this tool enters development.
