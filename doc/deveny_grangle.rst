Overview
========

   - ``deveny_grangle``: Compute the desired grating angle based on selected
     grating and desired central wavelength.  This routine comes with two interfaces.
     The default GUI features a dropdown menu for grating selection and contains error
     checking on the input for central wavelength.  There is a ``MAX_GUI`` option for
     computing central wavelength given the grating angle in addition to the standard
     GUI features.  Also included is a command-line interface, identical to the old
     IDL function.  Online help is available with the ``-h`` option.
