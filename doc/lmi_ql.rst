LMI Image Quick Look Tool
=========================

Status: *Planned*

Overview
========

   - ``lmi_ql``: A quick-look tool is needed for LMI images that can show
     recently acquired images with a simple bias-subtraction and flat-division.
     This tool will likely be based on [Ginga](
     https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and development can be guided by
     following some of the image-viewer steps included in PypeIt.


Usage
=====

Usage information will be added here once this tool enters development.
