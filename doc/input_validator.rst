====================
Input List Validator
====================

Status: *Planned*

Overview
========


   - ``validate_input_list``: The extant input list validation tool
     (https://confluence.lowell.edu/display/LDTOI/Validate+Input+List) was
     produced in 2015 using an old Java Runtime Environment that is not available on
     most modern operating systems.  As such, the tool is virtually useless.  This
     python program would provide this key functionality in a modern environment.

Usage
=====

Usage information will be added here once this tool enters development.
